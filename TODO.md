- Look at ordering effect - DONE
- Look at female/male effect - DONE
- Look at age effect 
- create combined driving performance metric ---
- Also look at no_audio/audio
- Quality control of data (remove strong outliers)
    - Z-score > 3 removed - DONE

- Look at sign of speed (e.g. intense they are above limit while calm they are below)
    - We can't actually reconstruct that... we have absolute speed and distance to target speed, but it is ambiguous what the target speed is
     (at least somewhat. there are cases where one can be certain, as the max possible speed is 150).

- Try non-parametric tests - DONE


paper: thematic analysis in psychology
    - pile similar statements by theme, which emerge during analysis
    - derive statements from the ux curves
    - put most representative drawings of ux curves into paper
- Argue that we had good reason to believe our hypothesis, but it did not happen? Why? Discussion starts. Methodological issues? Different presonalities? Future changes?




- Don't quantitatively analyse UX curves
    - Talk to Chris' group about qualitative methods/ UX curves

- Keep track of which participant makes statements/ux curves

- Compare our metrics with actual normal baselines (plausibility check)
