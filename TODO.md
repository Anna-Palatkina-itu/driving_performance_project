- Look at ordering effect - DONE
- Look at female/male effect - PARTLY - Compare whole experiment with 
- Look at age effect 
    - Old age vs young?
- create combined driving performance metric ---
- Also look at no_audio/audio
- Quality control of data (remove strong outliers)
    - Z-score > 3 removed - DONE

- Look at sign of speed (e.g. intense they are above limit while calm they are below)
    - We can't actually reconstruct that... we have absolute speed and distance to target speed, but it is ambiguous what the target speed is
     (at least somewhat. there are cases where one can be certain, as the max possible speed is 150).

- Try non-parametric tests - DONE


paper: thematic analysis in psychology
    - pile similar statements by theme, which emerge during analysis
    - derive statements from the ux curves
    - put most representative drawings of ux curves into paper
- Argue that we had good reason to believe our hypothesis, but it did not happen? Why? Discussion starts. Methodological issues? Different presonalities? Future changes?




- Don't quantitatively analyse UX curves
    - Talk to Chris' group about qualitative methods/ UX curves

- Keep track of which participant makes statements/ux curves

- Compare our metrics with actual normal baselines (plausibility check)



- depending on thematic piles, can compare different participant groups and check if it supports a conclusion
- Do not decouple statements? Do not change interview texts.


-participant section in paper where we describe their demoraphics and survey answers

-IF there is a large difference we could compare the survey groups


-prepare some diagrams and graphics for next meeting 



- need to remove blinking data from pupil diameter data?


Matrix: Conditions, Matrix

- How to establish baselines for eda and ecg and pupil? use our no_audio period as baseline?

- Left or right lane changes statistics?

- Assumptions about correlation with driving speed and bio physiological measures
    - e.g. HR in response to big speed change. Hypothesize


- Look excactly at where performance might be especially impacted, and then compare groups, instead of averaging literally everything. e.g. For each high speed change event, how good was the change.


- Limitations: No direction of speed difference

- Figure out how long participants need to compensate for speed difference. Use this as time interval?
- Also for lane adjustment. (e.g. also two lane adjustment, one lane adjustment)
- Ties in with reaction times


- Assume blinking baseline from first 1 min

- Pupil dilation baseline and relative values then with z-scores

- more conditions: 
    high/low speed adjustment
    speed high/low
    lane adjustment

    compared to hr, hrv, PD

- baseline hrv

- eda timewindows for tonic, slow, fast phasic amplitude

- Analyze the speedsign events

- Normalize combined driving performance
