paper: thematic analysis in psychology
    - pile similar statements by theme, which emerge during analysis
    - derive statements from the ux curves
    - put most representative drawings of ux curves into paper

- Try non-parametric tests


- Don't do what Bernd says about UX curves
    - Talk to Chris' group about qualitative methods/ UX curves

- Keep track of which participant makes statements/ux curves

- Compare our metrics with actual normal baselines (plausibility check)
